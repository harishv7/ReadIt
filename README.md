This project was created with a boilerplate - [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

This gave the project a basic structure to begin with. Otherwise, the main logic and code in `tests/Topics.test.js`, `Screens/` and `Topics.js` were all written by me.

As seen in the `package.json` file, the project has dependencies, mainly `react`, `react-native` and `react-navigation`.

The app sports three main screens - a HomeScreen (to view the top 20 topics sorted by upvotes in a descending order), AddNewTopicScreen (to allow users to add a new topic) and AllTopicsScreen (to allow user to see all topics so far).
